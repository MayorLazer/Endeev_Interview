#Author Note
Well, This is all I could code in 2 days straight of angular learning (I've no previous contact with angular frameworks nither typescript, this fancy IDE or ANY other javascript framework). Heck I bearly knew the basics of html/css/javscript). 

I'm amaze of how much I acomplish in these days, Wish I could've more time to polish concepts and code. I must say this project light a spark on me. I do love front-end

Could implement:
    - Several Components
    - 2 Services 
    - Routing
    - Models
    - Pipes
    - Bindings
    - Dependency injection
    - Some Directive  

My biggest issue the login... Couldn't figure out how to store the user data in the login so it could call erase metod, display profile, etc...
